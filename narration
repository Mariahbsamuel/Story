A thristy crow was looking for water but it could not find it. After a long search the crow found water in a mudpot but the water was too deep so the thristy crow couldnot drink water. The crow thought of a brilliant idea, he put some stones in the water to make the water come top. This way the hristy crow could drink water and quench its thrist.
